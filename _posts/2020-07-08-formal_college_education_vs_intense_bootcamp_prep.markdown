Hi everyone. After having graduated college, I was overwhelmed by the pressure of getting a job that would be fulfilling to me. Although college is great and all, there are a few major flaws in the system, specifically for CS majors. Besides for forcing you to take courses that you may never use in your life, the programming education you recieve in college is way too broad. For me, it just didn't seem sensible to apply for any job on the market that would hire me. What if I got put into a job that I hated? Computer science is an extremely vast field. Why would anyone want to get thrown into any specific area that it takes them? In a bootcamp, you can choose which area of computer science you would like to focus on and even recieve help finding that job that you will enjoy for a fraction of the time and money. Perhaps I should have come to this realization 4 years ago, but I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time because college does give you some grounding in basic knowledge that would have been hard to break into in such a fast-paced and intense environment.
