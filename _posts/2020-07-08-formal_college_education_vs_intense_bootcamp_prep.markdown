Hi everyone. After having graduated college, I was overwhelmed by the pressure of getting a job that would be fulfilling to me. Although college is great and all, there are a few major flaws in the system, specifically for CS majors. Besides for forcing you to take courses that you may never use in your life, the programming education you recieve in college is way too broad. For me, it just didn't seem sensible to apply for any job on the market that would hire me. What if I fell into a job that I hated? Computer science is an extremely vast field. Why would anyone want to get thrown into any specific area that it takes them? In a bootcamp, you can choose which area of computer science you would like to focus on and even recieve help finding that job that you will enjoy for a fraction of the time and money. 

Don't get me wrong, college teaches you many things that you need for life such as writing skills, communication skills, and even a bit of programming. Many of those skills are easily taught without recieving a formal college education. In my opinion, college is a bit dragged out and a lot of time is wasted. 

Now that I've been exposed to flatiron, I am starting to realize that the you can learn so much more about a topic if that's what you are focused on all day and night. It's difficult to balance so many different subjects. My entire four years of college were spent juggling from course to course, not being able to put much effort into any of them. When I focused on one course, I slowly lost concentration on the others.
