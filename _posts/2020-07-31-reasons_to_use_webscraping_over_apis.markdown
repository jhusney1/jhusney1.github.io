Beginning my first project in flatiron, I was offered a few options to go about the project. One involved using a messy database that was given to us at the start of the project. The other involved getting information through webscraping. Lastly, we were told that we can just retrieve the information through the use of available api's. It seemed that it would make so much more sense to get information through api's. Firstly, why would anyone want to deal with sql joins if they don't have to?
